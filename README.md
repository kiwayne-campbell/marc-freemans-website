This is a website i started devloping for a friend to get used to the basics of web design from the ground up rather than using a template.

# Basics

Firstly, I wanted to treat my friend like a client, so what the cient wants the client gets.

The next step was to then, ask the client to provide websites they like the aesthetics of.

What this lead, to was a site that wanted an aesthetics that incorporated parallax scrolling & with a minimal and black background design.

The hardest thing I have noted are a few things when it comes to front-end design:

1. in particular CSS aesthetics are very hard- you need a keen eye and it takes many desgns before you get something you might like.

2. Parallax scrolling can be implemented in many different ways, I found a way which seemed to require little CSS implementation of Z-index maniuplation.  It wasnot also too difficult to achieve the desired effect.

3. Still need to work on the mobile responsive design, but with some good CSS % -  you can almost get away with design elements specifically for that.

4. Sometimes, what you think looks good will different from what your clients wants, and you therefore must always seek to give them what they want.


The next thing to work on is deisnging a good menu bar for mobile, as the main thing- you have to wait until your client gives the go ahead.

That will be the next thing I update is the development for mobile screens & how the site looks for that.
